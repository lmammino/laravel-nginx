A base image for running Laravel apps on Docker.


## Image spec

This image allows to run Laravel applications using:

  - Nginx
  - php-fpm
  - supervisord (as parent process for both Nginx and php-fpm)

It offers a sensible configuration for running Laravel in both development and production environments.


## Usage

In your Laravel project create a `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM loige/laravel-nginx

# copy your sources in /app within the container
COPY . .

# Install PHP dependencies
RUN composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /app

# Install JavaScript/Node.js dependencies with NPM, compile assets with Mix
RUN yarn && yarn run production
```


## Configuration

The image can be configured at build time using build args and at runtime using environment variables

### Build arguments

  - `platform` (default `linux/amd64`): can be used to build the image for different platforms.

### Environment variables

  - `RUN_MIGRATIONS`: if set it will run the migrations at runtime.
  - `APP_ENV`: if set to "local" will install php dev depencies and run `yarn dev` on start


## Advanced configuration

If more advanced configuration is needed, all configuration files can be overridden with explicit `COPY` commands. You could copy the original files from this repo into your own project, change them and then override the original file by adding a `COPY` command to override the file in your container.

This is where the original configuration files are copied:

| **File location in repo** | **File location in container** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`./config/fastcgi-php.conf`](/config/fastcgi-php.conf) | `/etc/nginx/fastcgi-php.conf` | |
| [`./config/nginx.conf`](/config/nginx.conf) | `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` | |
| [`./config/php-fpm.conf`](/config/php-fpm.conf) | `/usr/local/etc/php/php-fpm.conf` | |
| [`./config/start.sh`](/config/start.sh) | `/usr/bin/start_app` | Needs to be executable |
| [`./config/supervisord.ini`](/config/supervisord.ini) | `/etc/supervisor.d/supervisord.ini` | |
